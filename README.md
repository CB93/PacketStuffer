Overview

The TCP Covert Channel is a Python program designed to hide data within TCP packets' Urgent Pointer field, allowing for stealthy communication over a network. This covert communication technique leverages the TCP protocol's Urgent Pointer mechanism, enabling users to exchange data in a clandestine manner.
Features

    Data Hiding: Conceal data within the Urgent Pointer field of TCP packets.
    Covert Communication: Facilitate covert communication channels over TCP connections.
    Secure Communication: Transmit data discreetly over a network without raising suspicion.
    Customizable: Adapt the program for various use cases by modifying the code as needed.
    Scapy Integration: Utilize Scapy, a powerful Python library for packet manipulation, to construct and send TCP packets with hidden data.

Prerequisites

Before using the TCP Covert Channel program, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

    Python 3.x
    Scapy library

You can install Scapy using pip:

bash

pip install scapy

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp-covert-channel.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd tcp-covert-channel

    Run the program, specifying the data you want to hide:

bash

python covert_channel.py "your secret message"

Replace "your secret message" with the data you wish to conceal within TCP packets. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and network access to send TCP packets.
